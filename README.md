# Search_Engine

This project implements a search engine that combines traditional text-based search with vector-based semantic search for enhanced retrieval capabilities.

**Key Features:**

* **Hybrid Search:** Integrates keyword-based text search and semantic vector search.
* **Enhanced Relevance:** Vector search captures semantic meaning, improving search accuracy.
* **Flexibility:** Allows for tuning and weighting of text and vector search results.

**Project Structure:**

* `Search_Engine.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the search engine implementation.

**Description:**

This project explores the development of a search engine that goes beyond simple keyword matching. By incorporating vector search, which leverages semantic embeddings, the engine can understand the meaning behind search queries and documents. This allows for more accurate and relevant search results, particularly when dealing with complex or nuanced queries. The notebook demonstrates how to combine text and vector search techniques to create a powerful hybrid search system.

**To Improve:**

* Add more detailed explanations within the notebook.
* Include examples and visualizations to illustrate the search process.
* Add ability to use different vector databases.
* Add ability to use different embedding models.
* Add ability to use different text search methods.
* Add more documentation.
